## App Architecture

<img src="https://bloclibrary.dev/assets/bloc_architecture_full.png" alt="TheSeriesDatabase" width=500 height=auto>

Using the bloc library allows us to separate our application into three layers:

* **Presentation**
    - This layer holds all the widgets, along with their blocs.
Widgets do not communicate directly with the repository.

* **Business Logic**
    - Consumes the domain model from the repository layer and expose a feature-level model which will be surfaced to the user via UI.
  
* **Data**
    - **Repository**: Abstract the data layer and expose domain models for the application to consume, facilitating the communication with the Bussiness Logic layer.
    - **Data Provider**: The data layer contains a single weather repository that is used to fetch weather raw data from the API.
